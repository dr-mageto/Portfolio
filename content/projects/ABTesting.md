A/B testing is a crucial method for optimizing marketing campaigns, allowing businesses to compare two versions of a campaign and understand which performs better. By systematically testing variations, companies can make data-driven decisions that enhance user engagement, increase conversions and maximize return on investment. This project leverages SQL to analyze A/B test results, providing insights into the effectiveness of different campaign strategies.

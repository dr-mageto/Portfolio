My goal for this project is to optimize inventory levels by providing near accurate forecasted demand to reduce stockouts, minimizing overstock and improving overall supply chain efficiency. This will lead to lower holding costs, better cash flow management and increased customer satisfaction. Apart from the normal python packages for EDA and data cleaning, I sort to use facebook prophet to come up with the machine learning model and Microsoft Fabric to for deployment

My passion for understanding societal challenges motivated me to undertake this project to evaluate the effectiveness of disaster relief programs in supporting community recovery. Disasters, both natural and man-made, have significant impacts on communities and ensuring that relief efforts are efficient and impactful is crucial. By analyzing data on disaster relief initiatives, I identified patterns, gaps and opportunities for improvement in how these programs contribute to rebuilding and strengthening affected communities.
